# BulkGoogleDriveDirectDownload
The aim of this code is to provide a way to bulk download google drive links from a folder. 

While trying to copy links from google drive, it only provides anarray of links. I wanted to map it to the corresponding name of the file.

Steps to use this:
1. Create a new Google SpreadSheet
2. Tools -> Script Editor
3. Enter the code.
4. Replace the '<id>'
       Open the desired Google Drive folder and get its ID in the URL from the browser location bar: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/<id>
5. Save and Run the script.
